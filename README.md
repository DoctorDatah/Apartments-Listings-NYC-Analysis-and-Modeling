# Apartments-Listings-NYC-Analysis-and-Modeling

**IN PROGRESS!** 

### Background

For international students it is hard to manage their finances is USA. Especially, when your parents are not super rich and your are not allowed to work more then 20 hours a week. 

Affordable and convenient accommodation is a basic requirement to live in States. As my university is in NJ (Drew University, Madison NJ) and I planing to do summer internship in New York City. It would require me to move to NYC, as commuting from NJ would be a time consuming and less effective. Obviously, am a student and I don't want to spend too much on accommodation. Hence, I decided to support my decision for apartment hunt with data analysis and machine learning molding. 


### Data Source

My first concern was how can I get the data for such analysis?
Well, I decided to scrap web for gathering relevant data. Most websites (like listed below) have strict rules for web scarping. Obviously, because of the reason that they don't others to take competitive advantage from data.  
-	streeteasy.com <br>
-	cityrealty.com <br>
-	zillow.com<br>

Anyways, if its on the web then its accessible either easily or a hard way. Moreover,I found a real estate website renthop.com who's design is simple enough for web scraping. 


##### Data Scraped:
- Url 
- Address
- Neighborhood 
- Number of Beds
- Number of Baths 
- Rent in dollars

##### Website Inference:
